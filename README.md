# Hindu_books_library_system
The program emulates a Hindu library system. Users can view, request, submit, or donate books like Ramayan and Mahabharat. It manages book borrowing, returns, and calculates fines for overdue submissions. Operating via a command-line interface, the system provides an interactive platform for managing religious texts.
